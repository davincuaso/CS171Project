Static BFS and DFS maze traversal using Javascript and HTML Canvas.

# Usage
Simply run index.html on your browser and press play to see both searches (DFS and BFS) traverze the static maze.

# Explanation
* P - Whether or not it traverses the maze and finds the goal state (targetPos)
* E - The static maze made using arrays
* A - Each node is apart of a queue or stack depending on the search which makes up the maze. The agent can then move by traversing each node utilizing both searches.
* S - The agent can sense whether or not a wall is in front of it and also if the current node is visited or unvisited.
